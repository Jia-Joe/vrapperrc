# vrapperrc_vsvimrc
1.Combine Eclipse with Vim.
2.Combine Visual Studio with Vim.

Here's my configuration files.
Work with Eclipse + Vrapper + gVim & Visual Studio+VsVim.


Use them to realize the same shortcut key remapping in vim _vimrc file.

Eclipse 4.4.2 + Vrapper 0.52. 
And you can use gvim when editing in the window of Eclipse with the shotcut of Ctrl + g.

All the shortcut key remapping in file _vimrc can be transplanted into Eclipse by 

1.Using the file  file _vrapperrc to config

2.Using the build-in preferences of shortcut keys in Eclipse

The path of Eclipse config file:

[YourWorkspace]/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/


Visual Studio 2013 + VsVim1.8.0.0
